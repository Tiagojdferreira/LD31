My learning notes during the development process.

[1st problem with Melon.js](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/melonjs/i4Cbr5R4L0U/tfqt8NrTkQUJ)

Wondering how to use dynamic image for animation of standing. Maybe define longer sprite with images needed and use:
<pre>
this.renderable.addAnimation("stand", [8, 9, etc.]);
</pre>
